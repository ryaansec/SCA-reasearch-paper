The paper, "A Practical Deep Learning-Based Acoustic Side Channel Attack on Keyboards," explores the growing threat of acoustic side channel attacks on keyboards. Using recent advances in deep learning and ubiquitous microphones in personal devices, the authors implement a model achieving 95% accuracy in classifying laptop keystrokes recorded by a nearby phone and 93% accuracy using Zoom-based recordings. The study emphasizes the practicality of these attacks with off-the-shelf equipment and suggests mitigation methods to safeguard user security. The authors introduce novel techniques, including deep learning models with self-attention layers, demonstrating improved performance in real-world scenarios. The research underscores the overlooked risk of keyboard acoustic emanations and their implications for user privacy and security.
